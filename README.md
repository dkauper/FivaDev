# Fiva Game - iOS/macOS Board Game

A SwiftUI implementation of the classic Sequence board game, renamed to "Fiva" for trademark reasons. This project creates a 2D board game experience that runs on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS.

## Project Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**: 2D Board Game Structure Conversion
- Removed 3D RealityKit components
- Implemented proper 2D SwiftUI architecture  
- Created game board with locked orientation as specified
- Added proper MVVM architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Integrated official Sequence game board layout

## Game Features

- **10x10 Game Board**: Proper grid layout with 1:1.5 aspect ratio elements
- **Official Board Layout**: Uses the authentic Sequence game card placement
- **Locked Orientation**: Board elements maintain position relative to device orientation
- **Player Hand Management**: Expandable/collapsible card overlay with glass effects
- **Game State Management**: Complete turn-based gameplay with sequence detection
- **Multi-Platform**: Supports iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS

## Architecture

The project follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:

```
FivaDev/
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameModels.swift      # Core data structures (Card, Player, BoardSpace, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameState.swift       # Main game state management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GameLogic.swift       # Game rules engine and board layout
â”œâ”€â”€ ViewModels/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GameViewModel.swift   # Main game controller and UI state
â”œâ”€â”€ Views/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameView.swift        # Main game container and setup
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameBoardView.swift   # Game board grid implementation  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PlayerHandView.swift  # Player hand overlay with cards
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GameInfoView.swift    # Game status and discard pile
â”œâ”€â”€ Utilities/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Constants.swift       # Game configuration and constants
â””â”€â”€ Assets.xcassets/          # Playing card SVGs and chip graphics
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Board Layout
- **GameBoard**: Rectangle that maintains orientation relationship with device
- **GameGrid**: 10x10 grid locked in position within GameBoard
- **Grid Elements**: Numbered 0-99, flowing left-to-right, top-to-bottom
- **Background**: #B7E4CC as specified in requirements

### Card Management  
- **Two Standard Decks**: 104 cards total (52 Ã— 2)
- **Special Cards**: Two-eyed Jacks (wild), One-eyed Jacks (remove opponent chips)
- **Dead Card Rule**: Can discard when both board positions are occupied
- **Hand Size**: Varies by player count (2-12 players supported)

### Game Rules
- **Objective**: Form sequences of 5 chips in a row
- **Corner Spaces**: Free for all players (represented by Joker/â˜…)
- **Win Conditions**: 
  - 2-3 players: Need 1 sequence to win
  - 4+ players: Need 2 sequences to win

### UI Features
- **Hover Effects**: 50% size increase on macOS hover (as specified)
- **Glass Effects**: Applied to player hand cards
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights valid moves, completed sequences
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to device orientation changes
