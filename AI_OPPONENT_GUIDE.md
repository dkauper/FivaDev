# ü§ñ AI Opponent System Guide
**Created: October 17, 2025, 4:25 PM Pacific**

---

## Overview

Complete AI opponent implementation for Fiva game with 3 difficulty levels. Supports human vs AI, AI vs AI testing, and mixed multiplayer games.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Human vs AI (Recommended for Testing)

```swift
// In your test code or ContentView
gameStateManager.setupHumanVsAI(aiDifficulty: .medium)
// Player 1 = Human, Player 2 = AI
// Game starts automatically
```

### 2. AI vs AI (Testing & Demo)

```swift
gameStateManager.setupAIvsAI(
    ai1Difficulty: .easy,
    ai2Difficulty: .hard
)
// Both players are AI - watch them play!
```

### 3. Mixed Multi-Player

```swift
gameStateManager.setupMixedGame(
    numPlayers: 4,
    numTeams: 2,
    aiSlots: [1, 3],  // Players 2 and 4 are AI
    aiDifficulty: .medium
)
// Players 1 & 3 = Human
// Players 2 & 4 = AI
```

---

## Difficulty Levels

  - No tactical planning

### Medium (Smart) ‚≠ê Recommended
- **Strategy:** Tactical decision-making
- **Think Time:** 1.0 seconds
- **Best For:** Challenging gameplay, testing logic
- **Priority Order:**
  1. Complete own FIVA (wins if possible)
  2. Block opponent's FIVA (defensive)
  3. Build 4-in-a-row (offensive setup)
  4. Use Jacks strategically
  5. Random valid move (fallback)
- **Jack Usage:**
  - Two-eyed: Place to complete/build FIVAs
  - One-eyed: Remove threatening opponent chips

### Hard (Strategic)
- **Strategy:** Advanced evaluation with planning
- **Think Time:** 1.5 seconds
- **Best For:** Expert-level challenge
- **Features:**

## How It Works

### Turn Flow with AI

```
1. Game starts
2. Check if current player is AI
   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí executeAITurnIfNeeded()
   ‚îÇ        ‚îú‚îÄ AI thinks (async with delay)
   ‚îÇ        ‚îú‚îÄ chooseMove() returns AIMove
   ‚îÇ        ‚îú‚îÄ playCardOnBoard() executes move
   ‚îÇ        ‚îî‚îÄ advanceToNextPlayer()
   ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Wait for human input
3. After player advances:
   ‚îî‚îÄ If next player is AI ‚Üí startAITurnLoop()
4. Repeat until game ends
```

### AI Decision Process (Medium)

```
For each card in hand:
  Get valid positions
  
Priority 1: Can I win?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Check if any position completes my FIVA
     ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Play there immediately

Priority 2: Must I block?
  ‚îî‚îÄ For each opponent:
     ‚îî‚îÄ Check if they're 1 move from FIVA
        ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Block that position

Priority 3: Can I build?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Find positions that create 4-in-a-row
     ‚îî‚îÄ Play best building move

Priority 4: Strategic Jacks?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Two-eyed: Place to complete/build FIVA
  ‚îî‚îÄ One-eyed: Remove threatening chips

Priority 5: Random
  ‚îî‚îÄ Pick any valid move
```

### Position Evaluation Algorithm

```swift
func evaluatePosition(_ position: Int) -> Int {
    // Returns max chips in a row including this position
    
    Check 4 directions:
    1. Horizontal (row)
    2. Vertical (column)
    3. Diagonal down-right
    4. Diagonal up-right
    
    For each direction:
        Count forward: position + direction
        Count backward: position - direction
        Include corner wildcards as friendly
        
    Return maximum count
}

Example:
  Position has 2 chips left, 1 right ‚Üí Score = 4
  Position creates 5-in-a-row ‚Üí Score = 5 (WIN!)
```

---

## Integration Guide

### Step 1: Add AIPlayer.swift to Models folder
Already created - see Models/AIPlayer.swift

### Step 2: Add AI Support to GameStateManager

```swift
// Copy from artifact "ai_integration" into GameStateManager.swift
// Add after existing properties section

// MARK: - AI Support
@Published var aiPlayers: [Int: AIPlayer] = [:]

// Add all methods from artifact
```

### Step 3: Update advanceToNextPlayer()

```swift
// Replace existing method with version from artifact
func advanceToNextPlayer() {
    gameState.advanceToNextPlayer()
    currentPlayerName = gameState.currentPlayerName
    mostRecentDiscard = lastCardPlayed
    
    print("üéÆ GameStateManager: Advanced to Player \(gameState.currentPlayer + 1) (\(currentPlayerName))")
    
    // NEW: Auto-start AI turn if next player is AI
    if isCurrentPlayerAI {
        startAITurnLoop()
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Add AI Controls to TestControlsView

```swift
// Copy sections from artifact "ai_controls"
// Add aiControlsSection and manualAISection to body
```

## Performance Notes

### Think Time Delays
```swift
Easy:   0.5 seconds  // Fast, casual
Medium: 1.0 seconds  // Natural feeling
Hard:   1.5 seconds  // Deliberate, expert
```

These delays are **intentional** for better UX:
- Makes AI feel "human-like"
- Gives player time to see board state
- Prevents instant moves that feel robotic

### Computational Complexity

**Per Move Decision:**
- Easy: O(n) - Linear scan of valid moves
- Medium: O(n √ó m) - Check all positions for each card
- Hard: O(n √ó m) - Same as medium (future: O(n √ó m √ó d) with depth d look-ahead)

Where:
- n = cards in hand (typically 3-7)
- m = board positions (100 max)
- d = look-ahead depth (future feature)

**Typical Performance:**
- Easy AI: < 10ms decision time
- Medium AI: 50-100ms decision time
- Hard AI: 100-200ms decision time

(Plus intentional think delays for UX)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2.5 (Optional Improvements)

**1. Minimax Look-Ahead (Hard AI)**
```swift
// Evaluate moves 2-3 steps ahead
func minimax(depth: Int, isMaximizing: Bool) -> Int {
    if depth == 0 || gameOver { return evaluate() }
    
    if isMaximizing {
        return moves.map { minimax(depth-1, false) }.max()
    } else {
        return moves.map { minimax(depth-1, true) }.min()
    }
}
```

**2. Opening Book**
- Pre-computed optimal opening moves
- Faster early-game decisions
- More consistent strategy

**3. Adaptive Difficulty**
- AI adjusts to player skill level
- Learns from player patterns
- Dynamic difficulty scaling

**4. Personality Traits**
- Aggressive: Prioritizes offense
- Defensive: Blocks more often
- Wild: Uses Jacks early/late
- Balanced: Current Medium AI

**5. Team Coordination (3+ Players)**
- AI teammates coordinate strategy
- Share FIVA-building efforts
- Focus fire on leading opponent

---

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Moving
**Symptom:** AI turn starts but nothing happens
**Check:**
1. Is `isCurrentPlayerAI` true?
2. Are there valid moves? (check `getValidPositions()`)
3. Console shows "AI thinking..."?
4. Any error messages?

**Fix:** Ensure `startAITurnLoop()` is called after `advanceToNextPlayer()`

### AI Makes Invalid Moves
**Symptom:** AI tries to play on occupied positions
**Check:**
1. Is `validateCardPlay()` being called?
2. Does `getValidPositions()` return correct set?
3. Are completed FIVAs protected?

**Fix:** Review `CardPlayValidator` integration

### AI Never Stops
**Symptom:** AI loop continues indefinitely
**Check:**
1. Is `isCurrentPlayerAI` returning correct value?
2. Does loop properly check for human players?
3. Are there multiple AI players in sequence?

**Fix:** Verify `aiPlayers` dictionary is correctly populated

### Performance Issues
**Symptom:** Lag during AI turns
**Check:**
1. Is AI doing expensive calculations synchronously?
2. Are there memory leaks in evaluation functions?
3. Too many debug print statements?

**Fix:** Profile with Instruments, optimize `evaluatePosition()`

## Known Limitations

1. **No Look-Ahead (Hard AI)**
   - Current Hard AI uses same logic as Medium
   - Future: Implement minimax for 2-3 move planning

2. **No Team Coordination**
   - AI teammates don't coordinate in 3+ player games
   - Each AI plays independently

3. **No Learning**
   - AI doesn't adapt to player patterns
   - Fixed strategy per difficulty level

4. **Greedy Evaluation**
   - AI evaluates moves in isolation
   - Doesn't consider move sequences

5. **No Opening Strategy**
   - First few moves are random (Easy) or greedy (Medium/Hard)
   - Could benefit from opening book
