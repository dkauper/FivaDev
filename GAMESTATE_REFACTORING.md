# GameState Refactoring Summary
**Date:** October 12, 2025, 6:20 PM Pacific

## Changes Completed

### 1. ✅ Created `Models/GameState.swift`
**New file with comprehensive game state model**

- **Instance-based struct** (no more static variables)
- **Player management**: 2-12 players supported
- **Team management**: 2-3 teams (Red, Blue, Green chips)
- **Team assignments**: Flexible `playerTeams` array for any configuration
- **Computed properties**: 
  - `cardsPerPlayer` (based on player count)
  - `fivasToWin` (based on team count)
  - `currentPlayerName`
  - `teamConfigurationDescription` (e.g., "3v3", "2v2v2")

**Preset Configurations:**
- `twoPlayer` (1v1)
- `threePlayer` (1v1v1)
- `fourPlayer2v2` (2v2)
- `sixPlayer3v3` (3v3)
- `sixPlayer2v2v2` (2v2v2)
- `eightPlayer4v4` (4v4)
- `ninePlayer3v3v3` (3v3v3)
- `tenPlayer5v5` (5v5)
- `twelvePlayer6v6` (6v6)
- `twelvePlayer4v4v4` (4v4v4)

**Factory Methods:**
- `balanced(players:teams:)` - Auto-distributes players evenly
- `custom(players:teams:teamAssignments:names:)` - Custom assignments
- `test(players:teams:)` - Quick testing

**Helper Methods:**
- `validConfigurations(for:)` - Shows valid team configs for player count
- `isBalanced` - Checks if teams are evenly sized
- `teamSizes` - Returns array of team sizes
- `teamConfigurationDescription` - Human-readable format (e.g., "3v3")

### 2. ✅ Updated `Models/PlayerColor.swift`
- Changed comment from "3 player maximum" to **"3 TEAM maximum"**
- Renamed `forPlayer()` to `forTeam()` for clarity
- Multiple players can share same chip color (teammates)

### 3. ✅ Updated `Views/GameStateManager.swift`
- Added `@Published var gameState: GameState = .threePlayer`
- Removed dependency on static `GameState` variables
- Updated all references:
  - `gameState.numPlayers`
  - `gameState.cardsPerPlayer`
  - `gameState.advanceToNextPlayer()`
  - `gameState.currentPlayerName`
  - `gameState.colorFor(player:)` instead of `PlayerColor.forPlayer()`

### 4. ✅ Updated `Views/TestControlsView.swift`
- Removed `@State` variable referencing static `GameState.numPlayers`
- Now accesses `gameStateManager.gameState.numPlayers` directly
- Added preset buttons for quick testing:
  - 2P, 3P, 4P 2v2, 6P 3v3, 6P 2v2v2
- Shows current team configuration (e.g., "3v3", "2v2v2")

### 5. ✅ Removed from `Utilities/Globals.swift`
- Deleted old `struct GameState` with static variables (lines 96-107)
- Layout constants now use fixed values for cardsPerPlayer

## Benefits

### Architectural Improvements
✅ **Proper separation of concerns** - GameState is now a dedicated model
✅ **Instance-based design** - Makes testing possible
✅ **Encapsulated mutations** - State changes through methods
✅ **Type-safe team management** - No more magic numbers

### Feature Support
✅ **Pre-game dialog ready** - `configure()` method awaits UI implementation
✅ **Manual testing** - `configureGame()` for interim testing
✅ **Flexible team configs** - Supports all valid 2-12 player combinations
✅ **Team-based gameplay** - Players assigned to teams with shared chip colors

### Code Quality
✅ **No more global state** - All state properly encapsulated
✅ **Better documentation** - Comprehensive doc comments
✅ **Validation built-in** - Player/team counts automatically clamped
✅ **Factory patterns** - Easy creation of common configurations

## Testing

**Quick Test Configurations Available:**
```swift
// In TestControlsView or code:
gameStateManager.gameState = .twoPlayer          // 2 players, 1v1
gameStateManager.gameState = .threePlayer        // 3 players, 1v1v1
gameStateManager.gameState = .fourPlayer2v2      // 4 players, 2v2
gameStateManager.gameState = .sixPlayer3v3       // 6 players, 3v3
gameStateManager.gameState = .sixPlayer2v2v2     // 6 players, 2v2v2

// Or use factory:
gameStateManager.gameState = .balanced(players: 9, teams: 3)  // Auto 3v3v3

// Or custom:
gameStateManager.gameState = .custom(
    players: 3,
    teams: 2,
    teamAssignments: [0, 1, 1],
    names: ["Expert", "Beginner 1", "Beginner 2"]
)
```

## Constraints Confirmed

- ✅ **3 TEAMS maximum** (Red, Blue, Green chips) - Yellow will never be implemented
- ✅ **12 PLAYERS maximum** distributed across 2-3 teams
- ✅ **Pre-game dialog support** - Ready for UI implementation
- ✅ **Manual testing supported** - All configurations testable now

## Files Modified

1. `/Models/GameState.swift` - **CREATED** (250 lines)
2. `/Models/PlayerColor.swift` - **UPDATED** (comments, forTeam method)
3. `/Views/GameStateManager.swift` - **UPDATED** (instance-based state)
4. `/Views/TestControlsView.swift` - **UPDATED** (preset buttons)
5. `/Utilities/Globals.swift` - **UPDATED** (removed static GameState)
6. `/Models/DeckManager.swift` - **UPDATED** (simulateDealToPlayers method)
7. `/FivaDevTests/DeckManagerTests.swift` - **UPDATED** (test assertions)

## Next Steps

**Phase 2: Critical Game Logic** (Next session)
1. Implement FIVA detection algorithm
2. Complete Jack special rules
3. Implement dead card auto-discard with UI indicator
4. Win condition detection

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All files updated and ready for testing
